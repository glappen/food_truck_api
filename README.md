# FoodTruckApi
This is an Elixir-based GraphQL API for searching food trucks in San Francisco. It is based on
the publicly available food truck data published [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `food_truck_api` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:food_truck_api, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
